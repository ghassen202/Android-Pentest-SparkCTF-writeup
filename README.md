These are some of the Mobile tasks that took place in SparkCTF 2024 edition.

## Task 1 - Androfire : 
<img src="/Images/t1.png"> <br> <br>
Well for the first one right off the bat we should know what we will be loooking for since the title and the description are hints that the Mobile app is using Firebase as a database
which is so common for Mobile applications but let's dive deeper into it. <br> 

We are provided with an .apk file so first thing we need to do is to decompile it with tools such as (apktool,jadx,bytecodeviewer..etc) we will use **apktool** for this one : <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t2.png"> <br>

We will check the manifest file which describes essential information about the app and how components(Activities,Intents,Services...etc) interact with each other: <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t3.png"> <br>
one of the services is a firebase database so first thing that comes to mind that we should look for the firebase url somewhere checking the `/res/values/strings.xml` we get the firebase url : <br>
<br> <img src="/Images/t4.png"> <br>
Now if the database is misconfigured and gives anyone read privileges we should be able to get it at `/.json` endpoint since all real time firebase database is stored as a json object : <br><br>

## Task 2 - Flag Dump :
<img src="/Images/t2_1.png"> <br>
For this one looks like we need to dump the app memory first thing first let's just open the app and see the interface (I already have a preconfigured android VM that i will be installing the .apk file into) : <br>
<br><img src="/Images/t2_5.png"> <br> <br>
Nothing interesting it's just displaying a text, let's try to decompile the apk this time with **jadx-gui** for a better source code review: <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t2_3.png"> <br>

In the MainActivity it's loading a library called flag_dump let's extract the library and decompile it using **ghidra** to try to undrestand the logic behind this : <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t2_4.png"> <br> <br>
from the two highlighted lines we can see that it is loading `local_c4` into memory starting from one particular address and storing `164 bytes`,
so there is probably something that is being moved from one memory location to another, let's use **adb (Android Debug Bridge)** to connect and install our apk file : <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t2_6.png"> <br>
Now in order to dump the memory for our android app we will use frida which is a  dynamic instrumentation toolkit
that is used for many things such as Read app memory,Hook methods/functions...etc for this we need to install [Frida-Server](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases) on our android
by selecting the right image and also install the fridump on our attacker machine that will dump the memory for us. <br> <br>
`On The Android Machine :` <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t2_7.png"> <br>
`On The Attacker Machine :` <br>
First we display all the packages and then we pass as an argument for fridump our taget package which is flag-dump. <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t2_8.png"> <br>
so the output is bunch of memory dumped data : <br>
<img src="/Images/t2_9.png"> <br>

we won't bother checking all of dumps the we already know what we are looking for : <br> <br>
<img src="/Images/t2_10.png"> <br>

## Task 3 - Flag Checker :
For this one the author created a Native Library that will check for the flag, So the first thing that should be done is to extract the library and try to undrestand the logic behind it,
before that i tried to go for a low hanging fruit by running **MobSF** On the apk file but nothing seems interesting, as usual let's decompile the apk and check our MainActivity : <br>

Indeed there is a test library that is being loaded let's check it out in ghidra : <br>

Upon checkibng the decompiled code it was quiet complex since there were too many functions but we will focus on the `` : <br> 

we notice one weird string, i dropped the decompiled code for chatgpt and asked for explanation and here's what i got : <br>
<img src="Images/chtgpt.png"> <br>

So it's xoring the string three time first with 0xd (13), 0x1f (31) and 0x13(19), let's write a small script that will xor the string backward to it's original stateor we could simply use Cyberchef : <br>
```python
import code
```
